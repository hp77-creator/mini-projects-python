# Bagels

It is a simple game where player has to guess a number which is already decided by the computer.

When the player guesses a number which has correct digits in the correct places, computer provides a feedback of 'fermi'

When player guesses a number which has correct digits at incorrect place then computer says its 'pico'

And when the player guesses a number which doesn't satisfy above two condition then a message of 'bagels' is printed,

The trick is to guess a number in the limited number of guesses and win it.

There is no reward for winning, you just enjoy it :smile:
